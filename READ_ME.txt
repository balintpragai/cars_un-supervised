### First a Disclaimer: ###
I did not use the exact data from the original link (https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset_smja.php?cod=1459), because my computer had problems with handling a .dat file for some reason. Instead I used the dataset from the original page of the dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/10/automobile), linked by the KEEL page at the very bottom. These 2 databases are identical from my understanding.
From the downloadable content on the archive.ics.uci.edu site I took the file 'import-85.data' and added column names from 'import-85.names' file and created the raw data in the attached file 'import-85.txt' that I'll work with in the notebook.

### How to run ###
1) The kernel I was using for the project was Python 3.11.0, please use the same kernel for reference.

2) In the begining of the notebook I use 2 'install' cells, you don't have to run them. Run them only if you don't have the respective packages isntalled.

3) Before running the read and write codecells, make sure you change the filepath inculded to the relevant filepath.

4) With these in mind, you can run the code from first cell to last. Please keep an eye out for the markdown cells inseted between codecells. I explain my findings, analysis and train of thought / reasonings for some decesions.

5) The first part of the code after reading the input is the EDA of the data and the semi-supervised learning is towards the end of the code, as well as my conclusion.
